**UPDATED GUIDELINES**

Updated 7/30/15

Welcome to Tsum Premium Gifters!

We are a friendly group of high volume heart senders.

Guidelines:

• Please "Like" this post so that we know you have read these guidelines

• Our group has a minimum sending requirement of 10 per day, or 70 per week.

• Weekly cycle is from Sunday to Saturday PDT (GMT-7)

• Failing to meet the minimum requirement will result in you being added to the pending removal list for the week and a warning will be issued via PM. You will then have until the end of the following cycle to remedy the situation or you will be removed. Multiple warnings may result in being asked to leave immediatly.

• Sending 8 or less daily (56 per week) may result in you being asked to leave the group immediatly.

• Members are not required to add or keep everyone in the group on their own lists, although it’s likely to your benefit if you do.

• *NEW* We have implemented a DO NOT ADD list located in the posts. Please respect the wishes of the members on the list and refrain from adding them.

• It is MANDATORY for all members in the group to have at least OUTGOING GAME NOTIFICATIONS ON so that the people you do add to your list can see how many you're sending to know if you are meeting the groups sending requirements. For this reason, if your outgoing game notifications are off, you will be issued a warning via PM and it could result in you being asked to leave the group. It has also been brought to my attention that if you know that everyone else in the group have their outgoing game notifications on, then you can easily determine if you have been added by another member or not, and choose whether or not to remove them from your own list.

• Currently we have no automatic way of tracking hearts, so all decisions for warnings and removals will be dealt with in an open discussion in the group chat. There is a post here where you can let us know who we should be looking at if you think their sends are below the minimum. Just make a comment on the post with the member in questions name, the number of hearts you have received from them, and the time frame in which they were received. We will then discuss the member in question and compare logs to get the members average sends for that time period. We would like to get as much input from as many members as possible on this as it's such an important matter, so if you see a discussion going on in chat, don't be shy! Please join in with your chat log totals!
*Unfortunatly, if you unauthorize during the week for any reason, your chat log totals will not be valid for this process as you will be missing data*

• If you are going away, or are otherwise unable to meet the minimum requirements for a few days, please make a comment on the "vacation" post, with your date of departure and expected return. We strongly recomend that you also unauthorize your game during this time both as a courtesy to other members so they will not be wasting time sending to you, and also, so that you will not have hearts expiring in your mailbox.

• If you will be away for an extended period or for whatever reason are unable to unauthorize your game, please consider temporarily leaving the group, and rejoining upon your return. Just make a comment on the "Open Invitation to Returning Members" post and you will be issued a pending invite to return at your convenience soon as you leave the group.

• Any member in good standing is welcome to invite new members so long as they have been on your list and consistantly sending 10/day or 70/week for at least 2 weeks and you you can vouch for their sending. You may also be asked to produce a summary of their sends to you and possibly screenshots of the chatlogs themselves.

• To keep the quality of our group high, joining via QR code should be kept OFF

• Check the Group Albums, for tips and other information

• Please read the other posts for more details and clarification of some of the guidelines listed here, and please "Like" the posts so we know you've read them.

• Please get approval before posting to the group wall to keep the feed clean

Our mission is to have a premium group of extremely prolific heart-gifters — our expectations are higher than many groups, to keep our quality high and the coins flowing.

Welcome, and have fun!
