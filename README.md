Welcome to Tsum Premium Gifters!

We are a friendly group of high volume heart senders.

Guidelines:
• Members should strive to send 10 or more hearts per day, on average
• Consistently sending less than 8 may result in being asked to leave the group
• Not required to add everyone in the group, though it’s likely to your benefit if you do

• Mandatory to have notifications ON
• If you are interested in helping keep the heart count, please let Meesh know.

• We love new members who are great heart senders! Please invite others, if you are confident they can gift 10 per day
• To keep the quality of our group high, joining via QR code should be kept OFF
• Check the Group Albums, for tips and other information
•Please get approval before posting to keep the feed clean

Real life comes first! If you know you won’t be able to gift ~10/day for a while, please temporarily leave the group and rejoin later. If you know you won’t play at all for more than a few days, deauthorize the Tsum app in LINE and post in the group Google Sheet the dates when you’ll be gone.

Our mission is to have a premium group of extremely prolific heart-gifters — our expectations are higher than many groups, to keep our quality high and the coins flowing.

Welcome, and have fun!
