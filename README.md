**Minor changes and clarifications to existing group guidelines**
**Edits and corrections have been made to this post.**

Hello TPG,

We've had another impromptu discussion in the group chat tonight, where we discussed and clarified some of the existing guidelines and made a few minor changes. The following is a summary of that discussion:

First off, you've probably notice a couple of new posts made tonight.

One is for letting us know if you will be away. Our group has a pretty high sending requirement, but we're not robots here! Life happens and people need to take time away from the game. If you 're going on vacation, or travel for work, or can't send your hearts for whatever reason, please let us know in a comment on that post. Let us know when you are going and when you will be back. If you are going to be gone for more than a couple of days, please deauthorize your game so others in the group won't waste time send you hearts that you can't return, and you don't have a bunch of hearts expiring in your mailbox. Theres nothing worse than seeing all those potential coins going down the drain... This will also minimize the chances of you being removed from other members' individual lists for low sending. If you can't deauthorize for whatever reason, please consider leaving the group temporarily until you can get back to sending. Let us know you are going and ask someone to invite you as soon as you leave so that you will have a pending invitation to return at any time.
**NEW**
FULL days unauthorized, and posted up will not count against you. It would be silly IMO to penalize someone who has informed us they will not be here. If you only unauth for a few hours or to sleep etc then it will count as a regular day for you. If you don't unauthorize, but still send you 70/week then your fine too. (e.g. you send 15/day for 5 days then dissapear for the weekend)

The second post is for alerting the members to potential low senders. If you think someone is consistantly low for the week (Sun-Sat) then please post up their names in the comment section and we will have an open discussion in the group chat where we can all compare numbers to get an accurate accounting of the member in question's sends. As noted in the post, if you see a discussion going on, please feel free to join in with your chat log totals. The more people we get involved, the more accurate our decisions will be.

Secondly, we talked about potential new members. So far, what was decided on was that any member is welcome to invite new members so long as they have been on your list and consistantly sending 10/day or 70/week for at least 2 weeks and you you can vouch for their sending. You may also be asked to produce a summary of their sending from your own chat logs, either by typing out daily totals for the two weeks or posting screenshots of the logs themselves.

Third, we talked about the dreaded axe.. since we allow 70/week as in our current set of guidelines, and the game resets on Sunday, we will define the week as being from Sunday through the following Saturday. I know we are from all over, but as I am the one currently posting this, we will use my timezone which is currently PDT(GMT-7), in this matter. The list of potential members to be removed will be posted on the Sunday following the end of the week, and any action that need to be taken will happen on the following Thursday

**EDIT** It's been brought to my attention that as we offer a weekly average of 70, then the grace period given to remedy the situation should also be a week**

This will give the members a full week to dispute the list, find members to vouch for their sending, or meet the minimum sending requirements. If you wish to dispute the committee's findings, please be prepared to produce chat logs or other members with chat logs to vouch for you. If you posted that you were going to be away and we missed it, please bring it to out attention so we can correct our mistake.

**EDIT**
Fourth, there was a misinterpretation of the 8 rule.

The rule as stated in the original guidlines is "Consistantly sending less than 8 may result in being asked to leave the group"
This rule has been ammended to the following: "Sending 8 or less daily (56 per week) may result in you being asked to leave the group immediatly."

Fifth, and the last thing we discussed tonight, was the pending invites. Originally, pending invites were issued to past members in good standing who chose to leave on their own when they themselves determined they were unable to comply with the groups guidelines. We decided to keep the spirit of this rule by extending the same courtesy to any active member in good standing who wished to take a break from constant sending, but who may wish to return at a later date. In addition, we would also issue a pending invite to anyone requiring an extended leave due to work or school or extended vacation where they are unable to deauthorize for whatever reason. Just let us know you are going and request a pending invite to return, just bfore you leave the group. You will then be immediatly issued a pending invite to return at your convenience.  Also, to keep our invites from becoming too cluttered, any invitation issued to a new member and not claimed within 24 hours will be removed. The inviting member is welcome to reissue the invitation, but if it is not claimed it will be removed the next day. this shouldn't really be an issue as we assume you will have talked to your invitee before sending the invite. Unfortunatly this also means that all existing pending invitations will be revoked. Most of them have been there for quite some time and are unlikely to be claimed anyway. As we are starting fresh here so to speak, our invites will also be started fresh.

That's it. If you have any concerns about any of these changes or clarifications we have made, feel free to bring it up with me in group chat. If you wish to participate in future discussions about our group, feel free to jump in the next time you see us hashing things out. As I stated previously, we are currently running this group by committee. all you need to do is show up and your voice will be heard.
